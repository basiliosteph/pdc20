        <p> K-pop girl group aespa swept up three prizes at the 19th Korean Music Awards, achieving a milestone as the rookie group with the most number of prizes at the awards.

            At the annual music awards ceremony held at Nodeul Live House on Nodeul Island, central Seoul, Tuesday, the quartet took home the song of the year award for its megahit “Next Level,” which dropped May last year.
            
            “Next Level” also won the newly created best K-pop song category and the group took home rookie of the year award.
            
            After its debut in November 2020 with the single “Black Mamba,” aespa has generated a buzz in the K-pop industry with its unique concept -- the members also have alter egos in the virtual world, or metaverse..</p>
